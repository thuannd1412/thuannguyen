Hi! My name is Thuan Nguyen. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department, [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu), advised by Professor [Thinh Nguyen](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~thinhq/). My research interests are communications theory, signal processing, and machine learning, including but not limited to channel quantization, channel capacity, unsupervised learning, and information-theoretic learning. 

I am going to graduate this Fall and looking for a Postdoc position.
